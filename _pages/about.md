Hello! I am Ed.

I am a PhD Researcher looking at the way that language changes with belief.

To do this I use computers to look at the words that people use and the way these change over time.
Find out more about my research [here](/research).

I also do other things, I enjoy writing, drawing, and producing general nonsense.
This stuff can also be found [on this site](/non-research).
