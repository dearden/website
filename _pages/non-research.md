When I'm not doing research I keep myself busy with a range of hobbies.
I love to write, draw, and paint.
I also enjoy to read and watch arguably too many films.
I have also been known to write and perform comedy, which you may already know if you've been unfortunate enough to attend one of my gigs.
All this stuff can be found scattered around this website.
