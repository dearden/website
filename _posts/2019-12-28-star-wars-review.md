I've been thinking a lot about The Rise of Skywalker (TROS) since I watched it on opening night.
The film delivered all the fast paced action, space ships, and lightsabers one expects from a Star War.
I had a nice time in the cinema, whooping when something blew up, laughing whenever something implausibly stupid happened, and cheering whenever everybody's new best friend [Babu Frik](https://collider.com/rise-of-skywalker-babu-frik-best-character/) appeared on screen.
But it left a sour taste in my mouth, as many people seem to agree.
I'm writing this review more just to air my thoughts about the film than to provide any hot new takes.

I'll start off with the good stuff.
The best moments in this film were when we got to see more of the silly, wonderful corners of the galaxy far, far away - Muppets and all.
We got to see new planets and meet new aliens.
The film makers made the excellent decision - as they have throughout this entire trilogy - of using practical effects and puppets to render these locales.
Babu Frik, the real star of the proceedings, exemplifies this and in his adorable little body, and garbled yapping, represents everything good about this film.

The film also has good space ships.
There's one particular scene where multiple ships come out of hyperspace at once that made me wee a bit.
But this kind of thing is also the problem.
The entire film was made up of scenes like this which seem designed by focus group to make star wars fans prolapse.
And there's nothing inherently wrong with that, who doesn't love a prolapse, except that here it's done at the expense of the story and characters that have been built up over the past two films.
The Rise of Skywalker could have done with listening to one of the core messages of the previous film, The Last Jedi - Let the past die.

Rise of Skywalker is a film that does more pandering than the Chinese government's conservation department.
It panders so hard that all the bamboo is gone.
I enjoyed it despite this because, in this already tired analogy, I am a panda.
And my bamboo is space ships, melodrama, and lightsabers.
But, just like real bamboo, these things alone are not enough to sustain me, and the only way they can bring nourishment by themselves is to have them funnelled down my throat at full blast, sparing no time for me to savour the taste of these things I love.
This was JJ Abrams' strategy in this film, and it doesn't pay off.
You can be fed much nicer bamboo in almost every other instalment of this franchise, along with a host of more nourishing accoutrements.

TROS has one trick up it's sleeve, and that's pushing the nostalgia button.
And the taste it leaves is all the more sour because _The Last Jedi (TLJ)_ showed us that Star Wars could be fresh and new.
And that it didn't need to have the same character arcs from the original trilogy, or the same baddies.
In TLJ, Rian Johnson told a story about learning from failure, and not living in the past, that was set in the Star Wars galaxy we know and love.
Oh the irony, that it was followed up by this.

This isn't the first time we've paid witness to JJ Abrams' nostalgia button.
It's what he's done his entire career.
His 2009 take on Star Trek brought the original crew of the enterprise back to the big screen and restored confidence in a slightly patchy series of films.
Mission Impossible 3 was another film in which he restored faith in a series that had just had a not-so-great entry.
For this reason, he was the perfect person to take on Star Wars when it was announced that Disney were making a new series.

Do you agree? Let me know in the comments.
