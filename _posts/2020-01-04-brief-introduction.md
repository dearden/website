Hello, and welcome to my research blog.
Over the remaining time of my PhD, I will try and publish articles relating to my research.
Some of these articles will be pitched at fellow researchers, and others at a more general audience.

The blog describe projects I am currently undertaking as part of my research, as well as providing more quickly readably summaries of my work (than academic papers).

I may also write about my experience of PhD-ing, and also general articles relating to disinformation, the subject of my research.

If you are interested in what I do, you can find a summary of my research [here](/research).

I may also write posts that have nothing to do with research, these will be on a [separate page](/personal-blog) so as not to confuse things.

Hopefully next time you come back to the site there will be more blogs, and I look forward to seeing you again!
