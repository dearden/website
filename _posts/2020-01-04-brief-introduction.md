Hello, and welcome to my research blog.
Over the remaining time of my PhD, I will try and publish articles relating to my research.
Some of these articles will be pitched at fellow researchers, and others at a more general audience.

This may mean providing accessible summaries of my work, or writing about my experience of PhD-ing, as well as more general articles relating to my [research interests](/research).
I may also write posts that have nothing to do with research, these will be on a [separate page](/personal-blog) so as not to confuse things.

Hopefully next time you come back to the site there will be more blogs, and I look forward to seeing you again!
