This is a separate blog from my [research one](/research-blog), where I will write about things that I do in my spare time.
The possibilities are endless.
I may share something I've written, a drawing I've done, or maybe even a short film, should I ever get my act together.
I've already cordoned off sections of the site for [photos](/photos) and [drawings](/art) to save the need for an entire blog post for a single drawing.

Have a look round, though there may not be much here for a while, and have a pleasant stay.
